<h1>📌 Web Data Extraction System</h1> 

This system was developed to automate a previously manual and time-consuming process that required multiple operators. It loops through a predefined list, inserting data into a web form. For each entry, the page returns client information, which is displayed in a DataFrame on the screen. The automation captures these results, stores them in memory until the list is complete, and then generates a unified Excel file for the user.

Before automation, this task was slow and required five operators to handle the daily demand. With this solution, the operation now requires only one operator for a few minutes to start the process, freeing time for other activities and significantly reducing costs.

### Overview
- **Automated Form Submission**: Iterates through a list and inserts data into a web form using automation.✔
- **Data Capture**: Collects returned client information and stores it in memory.✔
- **Data Consolidation**: Combines all results into a single dataset.✔
- **Excel Export**: Generates a unified Excel file with all extracted information.✔

### Key Benefits
- Reduced operational cost from 5 operators to 1.✔
- Saves hours of manual work daily.✔
- Provides accurate and consolidated data for decision-making.✔


### Use Case
Ideal for organizations that need to extract client-related data from web forms efficiently, reducing manual workload and improving productivity.
